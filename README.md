## Usage
1. Create a blank project repository.
2. Download an archive of this project and extract into repository directory.
3. **Run `. .dev/init.sh` and follow the prompts.** DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!
4. Commit all files to your repository and push.
5. To enable CI integration, login to [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) with your GitHub account, go to "Projects" -> "Add project", select your new project from the list and click on "Setup project" and click "Start building" button.
6. To start developing locally:
   - Make sure that you have `make`, [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Pygmy](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/pygmy.html) installed.
   - `make download-db`    
   - `pygmy up`
   - `make build`

## Build workflow
Automated build is orchestrated to run stages in separate containers, allowing to run tests in parallel and fail fast.

## FAQs

## Why `Makefile`?
- Consistent commands across projects - unified Developer Experience (DX).
- Standalone file that can be easily copied across projects.
- Works on all *nix systems.
- Does not require additional language or package installation.
- Workflow is no longer captured in places that were not designed for it: Composer scripts, NPM scripts etc.

## Why not Lando, DDEV, Docksal?
- Running the same workflow commands in Local and CI is a paramount.
- Current solution is pure Docker/Docker Compose and does not require and additional configuration generators.
- No dependency on additional tool.

## Why use `amazeeio` containers?
- [Amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io/) maintain their containers as they are powering their open-source hosting platform [Lagoon](https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon).
- Changes to containers are fully tested with every change using CI systems (part of Lagoon).
- Containers are production-ready.

## Why CircleCI?
- Very fast.
- Supports workflow.
- Supports parallelism.
- Provides remote Docker engine to run and build containers with layer caching.
- Allows customising build runner container.
- Flexible [pricing model](https://circleci.com/pricing/) (for proprietary projects). Free for open-source.

## Why dependencies.io?
- Configurable runners for different types of dependencies (PHP, JS, Ruby etc).
- Configurable base branch, new branch prefixes and assigned labels.
- Supports pre- and post-update hooks. 
- Flexible [pricing model](https://www.dependencies.io/pricing/) for proprietary projects.
